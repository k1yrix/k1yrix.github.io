# About Me

## A description
I'm just a literal 16 year old living out life as a tech nerd. Yeah, I know a lot about computers and basically tech in general. I have a tedency to mess around with computers almost every time I get my hands on one. (especially ones that look so new or it contains a gaming card) I have a junior certification with CompTIA's TestOut. I know a lot to the fact I don't have one siders. Whether if you talk about Android or Apple, Windows or Linux, or whatever that comes blasting into my face, <u>I can handle it</u>.

I started my gaming journey when I first signed up for Roblox back in April 2016. (and I still maintain my original account for over 8 years now!) After pandemic, I started to touch into other game platforms like Steam and Epic Games where I began branching out of Roblox as time goes on. I develop games on Roblox independently and I do a lot of things myself. (~~unfortunately the lack of motivation a lot of times can kill me~~) Ever since Roblox began developing problems since the pandemic, I have since distanced myself a bit to play other games I have interest in: Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike, and StarCraft to name a few.

I have a growing fond of being a distant train transportation enjoyer, especially in the likes of Chicago, New York City, and British transport. It started in around 2017 on Roblox with [Subway Testing](https://www.roblox.com/games/462255556/Subway-Testing-Classic) and it's [remastered version](https://www.roblox.com/games/285164228/Subway-Testing-Remastered), both by [Arsentic](https://www.roblox.com/users/41384661/profile/). I did not touch any more of NYC Subway-based games until mid-2022, when I began to take interest on [Potato Transit Authority](https://www.roblox.com/communities/5613578/Potato-Transit-Authority). Before I know it, I have since regained interest and expanded into the general space of MTA overall.<br>
Chicago was an interesting one. The space regarding CTA on Roblox was relatively small before its growth in 2023. I only gained interest after a vacation trip to Chicago in 2022. After the trip, I looked into any CTA games on Roblox and found the now classic [Red Line Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/6102248988) and then [Hollis' Blue Line](https://www.roblox.com/games/6458393580). I joined the surround community since then and have been one of the promenent members for CTA Roblox Community.<br>
I entered the British sector around 2016 or 2017 when [Grand Continential Railways](https://www.roblox.com/games/361547354/GCR-Grand-Continental-Railways) rolled around. The interest risen in 2020 with [Stepford County Railway](https://www.roblox.com/games/696347899/V2-0-Stepford-County-Railway), and I still oversaw the growth it has reached today. (I still remember playing the 1.4 era) It was enough interest to the fact I have taken interest of its unofficial wiki. I still commit myself to the wiki today as an Administrator.

Around 2024 is when things have changed, as I try to expand into learning Lua(u), C++, HTML, CADding, and more hoping to apply those skills...somewhere, with the possibility of Java coming up within the next year. In fact, one of those skills are applied towards the creation of this site!

### Here's something even more interesting
I run three unofficial sports accounts on Bluesky, and there are a few reasons for that:
- They're not on the platform
- They <i>are</i> on the platform, but are <i>neglecting</i> to post anything
- Same as point two, but they actually posted something then abanonded the account

With the crazy neglect, I decided to start them as soon as I got used to Bluesky.

The accounts I run are:
- [@notdetroitredwings.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/notdetroitredwings) (Detroit Red Wings, 443 followers)
- [@notnyrangers](https://bsky.app/profile/notnyrangers) (New York Rangers, 211 followers)
- [@nottigers](https://bsky.app/profile/nottigers) (Detroit Tigers, coming soon)
