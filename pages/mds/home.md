# Welcome to the absolute ~~dumbest~~ thing I've ever done
Apparently I'm rewriting my website after not touching this repo for so long. If you see this, then that means it's working.

# Why this over Carrd?
Well I want to be very freelancing over what I want to put, and I have a lot of freedom writing whatever the heck I want.

Even though Carrd is really nice, I just want to do whatever I want to here.

## ...and yes I had a Google Site before
...but ever since, the first edition of my website is LONG GONE now.

## My old Carrd site
If you do want to dig through it however, it's right [here](https://kirbix12.carrd.co).

# Site verison and Code
This is currently:
- Version 1.0 on GitHub
- Version 3.0 overall

Take a look at how I wrote this website [here](https://github.com/k1yrix/k1yrix.github.io).
