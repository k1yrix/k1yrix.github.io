# Welcome to the absolute ~~dumbest~~ thing I've ever done
Apparently I'm rewriting my website after not touching this repo for so long. If you see this, then that means it's working.

# I had a Carrd site before
Yes. Before this, I was well deep into Carrd, with all the customizations and ease of use out of the box. 

## Why this over Carrd now?
Well I have changed, and since then, I needed to move on and learn something new, so I decided to create one from scratch. (mostly, I cheated on some aspects through) I want to be very freelancing over what I want to put, and I have a lot of freedom writing whatever the heck I want.

Even though Carrd is really nice, I just want to do whatever I want to here.

### ...and yes I had a Google Site before
...but ever since, the first edition of my website is LONG GONE now.

### My old Carrd site
If you do want to dig through it however, it's right [here](https://kirbix12.carrd.co).
